Website for CSULA's Formula SAE Team, Golden Eagle Motorsports.

## Who We Are
We are Cal State LAâ€™s Formula SAE team, Golden Eagle Motorsports. Our team consists of students of several disciplines including engineering, computer science, business and more. We welcome students of any major since this team requires more than just engineering to perform.

## What We Do
Formula SAE is a team of students who develop and produce an open wheel, open cockpit-based formula style vehicle and compete with schools from around the world. Our competition consists of static and dynamic events testing our design, fabrication and reasoning skills compared to other universities. We push our team members to reach higher potentials by taking them through the engineering cycle which begins by creating requirements, then generating concepts, followed by completing detailed designs, prototyping, testing, manufacturing, and performance verification.
